If you would just like to run cybernetic locally, see the README.

If you would like to make and run cybernetic as a microblogging bot, make sure 
you have sbcl installed -

http://www.sbcl.org/

Then run install.lisp in the current directory to make sure you have the 
required libraries installed.

To make, run make.

To run, call cybernetic-microblogger with the identi.ca usrname and password
for the account you wish to post to as the first and second arguments. 
e.g. ./cybernetic-microblogger username password
